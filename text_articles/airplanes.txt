Deputy Mihai Lasca sent a question to the Civil Aviation Authority in which he requests to be explained what the "white lines in the sky" are, left behind by the planes, "what is the purpose of spraying them in the sky of Romania, as well as who carries out these sprayings ". The authority sent him a tongue-in-cheek reply inviting him to use a QR code to access some English explanations on NASA's website. Mihai Lasca sent the questioning to AACR at the end of October. "Hereby, as a deputy, as well as a member of the Commission for the Investigation of Abuses, Corruption and Petitions, as a result of numerous reports from the citizens of Romania, I REQUEST you to communicate the following:

- several citizens have sent me video footage of many "white lines of considerable length" in the sky above and in close proximity to their areas of residence, which persisted for hours without stopping. dissipate in certain areas with a not inconsiderable power Consequently, I ask you to communicate if you are aware of these "white lines in the sky", what they represent and what chemicals they contain. I also ask you to communicate the purpose of their spraying in the sky of Romania, as well as who carries out these sprayings".

The Civil Aeronautical Authority replied, ironically, recommending that they access QR codes, an allusion to the conspiracies according to which the world occult aims to control the population through QR codes : "Dear Sir, In response to your request, sent by electronic correspondence, registered at AACR, and considering the concerns regarding the contrails phenomenon that we have become aware of, for the purpose of better information and knowledge, we inform you that, on October 13, 2022, AACR voluntarily published on Facebook a series of materials intended to help clarify this topic. They can be accessed by scanning the following QR codes. Thank you for your attention to the concerns expressed by citizens." On the Facebook page of the Civil Aeronautics Authority, links were posted to the explanations provided by NASA and the British Meteorological Office in relation to the traces left by the planes in the sky.

The MP was deeply disturbed by the response he received and returned with a grammatically incorrect email to the Authority's director-general, expressing outrage at being asked to read articles in English. "Mr. director, in Romania, in case you haven't read art. 13 of the Romanian Constitution, the official language is Romanian. If you do not want to formulate an answer in Romanian to the Request of a Deputy elected by the Romanian People in the Romanian Parliament, I can send you a sheet of paper to write your resignation in the ROMANIAN LANGUAGE. If you can't handle it, I'll send you a Romanian citizen to help you write it. Until then, I REQUEST YOU AGAIN to notify me URGENTLY:

- what are the "white lines in the sky" (chemtrails AND NOT contrails) and what chemicals they contain
- what is the purpose of their spraying in the sky of Romania, as well as who carries out these sprayings"

The white lines in the sky left behind by planes flying at high altitude are at the center of a very popular conspiracy in the media that promoted during the pandemic the theory that the Covid virus was manufactured in laboratories, and that vaccines are harmful. The theory of chemical trails (chemtrail, chemical trail) claims that some tracks that appear to be condensation trails left by military and civilian aircraft, contain chemical or biological agents, deliberately sprayed for secret purposes, within the framework of some clandestine government programs. Conspiracy theorists claim that some military and civilian aircraft spray chemicals, especially aluminum and barium. However, the white lines in the sky are just normal contrails left by aircraft engines, and there is no scientific evidence to the contrary. 

Mihai Lasca was elected to the Parliament on the AUR lists and now he joined the Party of Patriots of the Romanian People.
