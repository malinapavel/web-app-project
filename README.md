# web-app-project

## Website application name: WeirdoWorld
## Topic: news portal with bizarre stories from all around the world

## Requirements:
  There will be three types of accessors to the website application: visitor, user and an admin. 
  All three can browse through the articles, read them, search for a specific word on the search bar and sort articles based on two criteria: sorting by date and sorting by 
  popularity. Popularity will be defined as the number of times a certain news article has been accessed. For users and admin, though, certain functionalities are unlocked if 
  they log-in. In case users do not possess an account, it is required to create an account (admin account will be “hardcoded”, so there’s no need for registration 
  in this case).

  The aforementioned functionalities for users include adding a comment to an article or sending video footage/images/text that would make for a potential article. The admin, 
  on the other hand, can add new articles, remove comments and process what materials the users have sent, all of that in a special admin panel.
  
  
## Specifications:
  For the website design (front-end), HTML and CSS will be used, responsiveness will be granted by Javascript, whilst the Django framework comprises the back-end part of this website. 
  The news articles, users, comments etc. will be stored in a database, whose operations will be handled using SQLite.


### Consider the following branches:
    - 'master' branch: all the commits related to all webpages 
    - 'about-us' branch: all the commits related to the 'about-us.html' web app
    - 'contact' branch: all the commits related to the 'contact.html' web app
    - 'sign-up' branch: all the commits related to the 'sign-up.html' web app
    - 'django_pj' branch: all the commits related to the backend part of the web app
    
    => all branches (except the master, of course) will be merged into master branch
